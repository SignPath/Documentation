**Title:** Build system integration - SignPath.io

# Build system integration

@[toc]

## Abstract

This section describes how SignPath can be integrated into automated builds using continuous integration software. You can use the PowerShell module provided by SignPath, or directly call the Web API to submit signing requests.

All necessary IDs can be found on the signing policy details page, including a code snippet that calls the PowerShell module.

## Authorization

Before accessing the API, you have to create a CI User in the User section of the SignPath application.

The API token is displayed when a new CI user is created. (If you lose the API key, you will need to generate a new one.)

Make sure to keep the access token in a secure location. Most Continuous Integration (CI) systems provides a mechanism to store secrets, which is usually the best place to keep API tokens. If you use several distinct systems for API access, we recommend that you create individual CI User accounts in SignPath.

## PowerShell

SignPath can be integrated in your automated build process by using our API. For convenience, we provide a PowerShell module that can be used from within your build/deploy chain. The module can be downloaded from [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SignPath/).

Signing requests can be created by calling the following commands via PowerShell:

```powershell
# Install module from PowerShell Gallery
Install-Module -Name SignPath

# Submit a signing request and get a signing request ID without waiting for completion ...
$signingRequestID = Submit-SigningRequest
    -CIUserToken $CI_USER_TOKEN
    -OrganizationId $YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID
    -CertificateConfigurationId $CERTIFICATE_CONFIGURATION_ID
    -InputArtifactPath $PATH_TO_INPUT_ARTIFACT

# ... and download the signed artifact later.
Get-SignedArtifact
    -CIUserToken $CI_USER_TOKEN
    -OrganizationId $YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID
    -SigningRequestId $signingRequestID
    -OutputArtifactPath $PATH_TO_OUTPUT_ARTIFACT

# Or submit a signing request and wait for completion.
Submit-SigningRequest
    -CIUserToken $CI_USER_TOKEN
    -OrganizationId $YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID
    -CertificateConfigurationId $CERTIFICATE_CONFIGURATION_ID
    -InputArtifactPath $PATH_TO_INPUT_ARTIFACT
    -OutputArtifactPath $PATH_TO_OUTPUT_ARTIFACT
    -WaitForCompletion
```

## HTTP REST API

In case the PowerShell module is not sufficient, you can communicate directly with our API by calling our public HTTP REST endpoints.

### Base URL and authentication

SignPath.io uses bearer authentication.

| Common API arguments            |     |
| ------------------------------- | --- |
| Base URL                        | `https://app.signpath.io/API/v1/`OrganizationId
| Authorization HTTP header field | `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

You need to provide these values for every single API request.

### Submit a signing request

| Synopsis           |      |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| URL                | `/SigningRequests`
| Method             | POST
| Encoding            | multipart/form-data
| `SigningPolicyId`  | Signing policy for which you want to create the signing request
| `Artifact`         | Artifact file
| `Description`      | Optional description for your signing request (e.g. version number)

**Example:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CI_USER_TOKEN" \
     -F "SigningPolicyId=$SIGNING_POLICY_ID" \
     -F "Artifact=@$PATH_TO_ARTIFACT" \
     -F "Description=$DESCRIPTION" \  
     https://app.signpath.io/API/v1/$ORGANIZATION_ID/SigningRequests
```

**Success result:** HTTP status code `201`. A HTTP `Location` response-header field is returned with the URL of the created entity.

### Check the status of a signing request

| Synopsis   |      |
| ---------- | ---- |
| URL        | `/SigningRequests/`id <br> (`Location` response-header field from `/SigningRequests`)
| Method     | GET
| Parameters | none

**Example:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CI_USER_TOKEN" \
     https://app.signpath.io/API/v1/$ORGANIZATION_ID/SigningRequest/$SIGNING_REQUEST_ID
```

**Success result:** HTTP status code `200`. Status of the signing request in JSON format:

```json
{
  "status":"Completed",
  "description":"called by curl",
  "projectId":"edd545ef-e113-48ba-aba7-de2d59ea2f26",
  "projectName":"SignPath Test Project",
  "signingPolicyId":"9ebd30b0-ef6b-4e46-a248-103516bc36fc",
  "signingPolicyName":"test-signing",
  "uploadedArtifactLink":"https://app.signpath.io/API/v1/a05be341-8a85-4c06-828a-710459e325ab/SigningRequests/a15e4d4f-7e03-4b15-9e2e-f3d8daeeaa75/UploadedArtifact",
  "signedArtifactLink":"https://app.signpath.io/API/v1/a05be341-8a85-4c06-828a-710459e325ab/SigningRequests/a15e4d4f-7e03-4b15-9e2e-f3d8daeeaa75/SignedArtifact"
}
```

**Possible `status` values:** `WaitingForApproval`, `QueuedForProcessing`, `Processing`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Denied`, `Canceled`

### Download the signed artifact

Once the signing request has been successfully completed, the status response contains a `signedArtifactLink` field with a link to the signed artifact file. It can easily be retrieved by issuing the following command:

| Synopsis   |      |
| ---------- | ---- |
| URL        | `/SigningRequests/`id`/SignedArtifact` <br> (`signedArtifactLink` field from `GET SigningRequests/`id)
| Method     | GET  |
| Parameters | none

**Example:**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CI_USER_TOKEN" \
     -o $LOCAL_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_ARTIFACT \
     https://app.signpath.io/API/v1/$ORGANIZATION_ID/SigningRequest/$SIGNING_REQUEST_ID/SignedArtifact
```

**Success result:** HTTP status code `200`. Returns the binary content of the signed artifact.
