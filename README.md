# SignPath.io documentation

**This is the documentation and background information displayed on [about.signpath.io](https://about.signpath.io/).**

In the future, merging into the `master` branch will automatically deploy the website and merging into a (yet-to-create) `develop` branch will deploy to a staging system. Currently, for production systems, the deployment has to be started manually.
