# SignPath.io documentation

**This repository contains the product documentation and general code signing information displayed on [signpath.io](https://about.signpath.io/).**

The main sections are

* SignPath.io features
* Code signing 
  * General information
  * Code signing for Windows (Authenticode, ClickOnce, OPC/VSIX, NuGet)
* SignPath product documentation

In the future, merging into the `master` branch will automatically deploy the website and merging into a (yet-to-create) `develop` branch will deploy to a staging system. Currently, for production systems, the deployment has to be started manually.
