<h1 id="key-concepts">Key concepts</h1>
<p>The major entities in SignPath are <strong>projects</strong>, <strong>certificates</strong> and <strong>users</strong>. They are all part of your <strong>organization</strong>.</p>
<p>Each <strong>project</strong> consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>artifact configuration</strong> that defines how an artifact is structured, and which parts should be signed as well as the signing methods</li>
<li>one or more <strong>signing policies</strong> (typically <em>test-signing</em> and <em>release-signing</em>) that declare the rules for signing and specify a <strong>certificate</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When an artifact needs to be signed, a <strong>signing request</strong> for a specific <strong>project</strong> and <strong>signing policy</strong> is created.</p>
<p>This UML class diagram shows the fundamental relationships:

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<p>Define a project for each artifact, or for each set of artifacts that should be signed in a single step.</p>
<p>Typically, there is one set of artifacts per software product, development team or project. If you use continuous integration (CI) tools, the artifacts will be the output of a single build configuration, or a subset of that output. Or maybe you have several build configurations that create different versions of structurally identical artifacts – those can still be represented by a single SignPath project.</p>

<p class="admonition-title"><img src="https://about.signpath.io/wp-content/uploads/info.png" alt="Information"> Use build automation</p>
<p>If you don’t use a CI system or some other kind of build automation, we highly recommend starting now. A reproducible build process is a most basic ingredient for safe code signing.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="artifact-configurations">Artifact configurations</h2>
<p>At the core of each SignPath project is an artifact configuration. It describes the file type of your artifact and a corresponding code signing method (e.g. an EXE file signed with Authenticode). You can also sign multiple files or complex nested artifacts, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>a ZIP archive containing several artifacts that need Authenticode signing</li>
<li>a CAB file containing EXE and DLL files, all of which should be signed with Authenticode</li>
<li>an MSI installer containing an Office add-in, which in turn contains DLLs – the MSI file and the DLLs should be signed using Authenticode, while the Office add-in has a ClickOnce manifest that requires manifest signing</li>
</ul>
<p>For complex nested artifacts, creating the artifact configuration is a bit more involved. You need to create an XML file that describes the artifact, with all its nested elements, and the signing actions you want performed on these files. See <a href="3_artifact_configuration.md.html">creating an artifact configuration</a>.</p>
<p>Note that a tight configuration of your artifact reduces the risk of unwanted signatures. Add constraints liberally.</p>
<h2 id="signing-policies">Signing policies</h2>
<p>The same project is usually signed for different purposes, most commonly test- and release-signing. Define signing policies for each project as required.</p>

<p>You might need more signing policies. For example, you might want to introduce an approval process for some submitters, but not for others. Or you might use different certificates for various kinds of builds. Define any number of signing policies to meet your organization’s requirements.</p>
